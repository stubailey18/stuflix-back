# StuFlix (Back)

This is the Java (Spring Boot) back-end of an app for querying the [Open Movie Database] (https://www.omdbapi.com/). The app exploits Spring Security and JWTs to secure the app and also provides for the fetching of data from the OMDB API.

You can see the app in action [here](https://stubailey18.com/stuflix). The code for the front-end part of the app is accessible [here](https://github.com/stubailey18/stuflix-front).
